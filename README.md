# Example app

This is an example app to show how to use the editor libraries in a React app.

A source of inconvenience is `prosemirror-dev-tools` since it doesn't unmount properly when navigating the pages and uses some deprecated API interfaces filling the console with various errors and warnings.

## How to install

This project uses Yarn workspaces so you don't really have to install anything. By running `yarn` in the root folder all the dependencies should be installed automatically.

## Commands

* `yarn start` to start the example app
* `yarn lint` to run ESLint
